Investment Banker in a Box
==========================

**Disclaimer: This is a prototype and should not be used as financial advise**

Use case for using LLM in acting as an investment banker and analysing financial statements.

So far this is a prototype, more like an assistant than a banker, but is shows the great potential with
AI enabled applications and how we with very little effort can create powerful applications.

On my MacBook Pro with scaled down cloud services, Apple's annual report with 80 pages was analyzed in 18 minutes at a cost of $0.50 on Azure OpenAI.
Might sound like a long time but calculate that over a month running 24/7 and compare with the result and cost of a team of analysts.

Imagine what can be developed in a couple of weeks, adding things like:
- Add an automatic flow for financial statements
- Use multiple documents per company
- Optimize for speed
- Adding more prompts
- Finetune the prompts
- Finetune an LLM
- Structured return data into a database
- Web interface for administration and statistics
- Adding web search to compare with for example industry benchmark and historical data
